This package helps you to write better tests around model relations in Laravel. 
It validates methods and the database schema setup for all the modells.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require schenke-io/laravel-relation-manager
```

## Usage

### Writing manual tests 

You can enhance one of your tests with new assertions 
related to model relations. 
They will verify if the models have the 
relations setup and are working with the database well (e.g. migrations).


In this example the test verifies the following:
+ `Country::class` exists and is a model
+ `Capital::class` exists and is a model
+ in `Country::class` is a HasOne-relation to `Capital::class` which works with the database 


```php
# tests/Feature/ModelRelationTest.php 
namespace Tests\Feature;

use Tests\TestCase;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
use SchenkeIo\LaravelRelationshipManager\Phpunit\AssertModelRelationships;
use App\Models\Country;
use App\Models\Capital;
use App\Models\Regions;

class ModelRelationTest extends TestCase 
{
    use RefreshDatabase;
    use AssertModelRelationships;
    
    public function testCountryRelationships()
    {
        $this->assertModelHasOne(Country::class, Capital::Class);
    }
}

```
Another way to write the test is using full class names like:
```php

...

        $this->assertModelHasOne('App\Models\Country', 'App\Models\Capital');

...        

```


## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
